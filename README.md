## 🌟 Motivation

This repository is built to:

- Practice C++ coding
- Revise concepts with simple examples
- Prepare for college practicals & assignments
- Improve logic building for coding interviews

## 🎮 Featured Project: Tic-Tac-Toe Game

A simple **2-player terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe** game built in C++. Great for applying loops, arrays, and logic structures.

📌 **File:** `Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.cpp`  
🧠 **Concepts Used:**  
- 2D board representation  
- Turn-based user input  
- Win/draw logic  
- Functions & input validation
  
## 🛠️ How to Compile & Run

Use any C++ compiler like `g++`:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o output
./output
g++ Tic-Tac-Toe-Game.cpp -o ttt
./ttt
```

Player 1 (X)  -  Player 2 (O)
